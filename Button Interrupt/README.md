# Button Interrupt
The attached project simulates an LED output that is toggled when a button is pressed. We were able to control the blinking of the LED to an interrupt instead of directly being connected to the button. To do this, we disabled the watchdog timer, set the LED as the output, the button as the input, enable the interupt for the button, enabled a pullup resistor fo rthe button, and then clear the interrupt flags for the button. The toggling of the LED hapens in the interrupt function, using an XOR gate to toggle the state of the LED.
